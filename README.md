2022GGJ Game

1. Our team's game is a ecscape, horror, puzzle game, 
in which 3 people are trapped in a biochemistry laboratory and they fight/cooperate with each other to finish their task—— killing others or ecscaping the building.

2. Only a player itself knows it's a lamb or a wolf, and player will use a console to make decision, observing others and communicating to find out who is their friends and enemies.

3. Remark: This game's story and interface is highly inspired by and similar to GTFO.
